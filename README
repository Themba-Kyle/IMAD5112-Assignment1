MY diet monitor application that suggests meals based on time of the day 
 

Run the application on an emulator in android studio 
 

HOW TO USE 
Users should type morning, afternoon or evening on Time Of Day and click the submit button for a result 
The application then suggests meals based on the time input 
If any other time input is typed the application will read it as an invalid input 
You can reset the time of day by clicking the reset button  

 
Example 
When one types “morning” and clicks the submit button, the app will show Breakfast: Toast , Eggs 
When one types “afternoon” and clicks the submit button the app will show Lunch: Salmon Salad 
When one types “evening” and clicks the submit button the app will show Dinner: Rice and Chicken 
When one types anything besides the listed the application will show an error
